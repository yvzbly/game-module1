Step 1: Organize Project

Ensure that your project structure is organized and files are in the correct locations.
Verify that the card images and image references in your HTML are accurate.

Step 2: Create the Deck and Player Classes

Create JavaScript classes for Card, Deck, and Player as previously mentioned.
Ensure that the classes can handle card creation, shuffling, dealing, and managing player hands.

Step 3: Initial Game Setup

Implement the initial game setup in your index.js:
Create instances of the Deck, Player, and Player (for the dealer).
Set up event listeners for the "Deal," "Hit," and "Stand" buttons.

Step 4: Implement "Deal" Button Logic

When the "Deal" button is clicked, implement the logic to deal the initial two cards to the player and dealer.
Load and display the card images for the player and one face-up card for the dealer.

Step 5: Implement "Hit" Button Logic

When the "Hit" button is clicked, add a card to the player's hand.
Display the card image for the player's new card.
Check if the player busts (hand value exceeds 21).

Step 6: Implement "Stand" Button Logic

When the "Stand" button is clicked, complete the dealer's turn by drawing cards until the total value is at least 17.
Reveal the dealer's face-down card and display the card image.
Determine and display the game result (player wins, dealer wins, or tie).

Step 7: Implement Restart and Game Messages

Add functionality to restart the game (reset all variables and clear card images).
Display game messages to inform the player of outcomes.

Step 8: Advanced Features (Optional)

Add features like blackjack detection, animations, and a more interactive UI to enhance the game.

Step 9: Testing and Debugging

Test your game thoroughly to identify and fix any issues.
Use the browser's developer tools to debug JavaScript code.

Step 10: CSS Styling

Continue styling your game using CSS to improve the visual appeal.
